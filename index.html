        <h1>I made a thing - Seed-o-matic <small>Apr 26</small></h1>

        <p>
          Saying that seeding in Ruby on Rails was a bit of an afterthought is generous, at best. For anyone who hasn't tried the built-in seeding functionality in Rails, here's a brief overview:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>Make a file called <code>db/seeds.rb</code></li>
          <li>When you run <code>rake db:seed</code>, Rails will require that file.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          This stunning piece of engineering works pretty much the first time you run your seeds. At Influitive, we do a lot of crazy things with seeds. We're a multi-tenant database, and so we need to run seeds for every tenant seperately. On top of that, we need to re-run our seed file with every deploy, to ensure that any system seeded data is updated correctly (and will continue to do so as we add new clients to our system).
        </p>

        <p>
          We started off with a fairly ad-hoc approach to dealing with seeds, which slowly morphed into a set of best practices, then code that encapsulated those best practices, and finally an independently tested gem that we rely on to seed all data in our system.
        </p>

        <h2>Introducing Seed-O-Matic</h2>

        <p><a href='http://github.com/ryanbrunner/seedomatic'>Seed-O-Matic</a> makes seeding easy. It works similarly to <code>db:fixtures:load</code>, but has several optimizations built in to support what you'll commonly need to do when seeding data.</p>

        <h3>A Quick Tour</h3>

        <p>Let's say you need to seed some data into your application. You have <b>widgets</b>, which need to be seeded once and might be updated by users later, and <b>widget types</b>, which are system-defined and can't be edited by users. Setting this up with Seed-o-Matic is as easy as:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <h3>Define a seed file</h3>
            <p>A typical seed file looks like this:</p>

            <pre><code>
    widgets:
      match_on: code
      seed_mode: once
      items:
        - name: Cog
          code: cog
          widget_type_lookup:
            code: cogs_gears
        - name: Gear
          code: gear
          category_lookup:
            code: cogs_gears
        - name: Bolt
          code: bolt
          widget_type_lookup:
            code: hardware
        - name: Nut
          code: nut
          widget_type_lookup:
            code: hardware
    widget_types:
      match_on: code
      items:
        - name: Cogs and Gears
          code: cogs_gears
        - name: Hardware
          code: hardware
            </code></pre>

            <p>You can put everything in the same seed file, or split it into multiple seed files. Drop them all into <code>config/seeds</code>.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Run <code>rake seedomatic:seed</code>.</h3>
            <p>
              Your seeds will be loaded into your database, like magic. Seeds depend on other seeds? No problem, lookups
              will take care of finding the right seed for you, and will even handle lookups defined in a later seed file
              again.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Run <code>rake seedomatic:seed</code> again.</h3>
            <p>
              And again, and again. By specifying a <code>match_on</code> key, Seed-o-matic makes sure that duplicate records
              aren't generated. Don't want to overwrite user data? Set <code>seed_mode</code> to <code>once</code> and Seed-O-Matic will only run seeds for new records.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
