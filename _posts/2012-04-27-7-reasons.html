title: Why aren't you organizing your local user group?
---
<p>
  I just got back from my second <a href='http://railsconf.com'>RailsConf</a> yesterday. I had such an amazing time. I'm continually surprised by how friendly, open, and smart the Rails community is, and I met tons of interesting, intelligent people.</p>

<p>
  One thing I promised myself is that this year, I would get up and do some sort of a talk. I didn't get a chance to do a full session, so I signed myself up for a <b>lightning talk</b>. For those unfamiliar, Dr. Nic runs a lightning talk session every year. You get either 1 or 5 minutes to quickly talk about whatever topic you'd like. It's an exhilirating, fun experience, and I totally recommend it.
</p>

<p>
  A few people were asking for my slides, which are available <a href='http://www.slideshare.net/enki42/7-reasons-you-should-volunteer-for-your-local-user-group'>here</a>, but I thought I'd summarize my talk on here, since the slides aren't particularly well suited to online reading.

<h2>7 Reasons you should help organize your local user group</h2>

<p>
  About 4 months after I started working with Rails, I decided to set up a Hack Night with the <a href='http://torontorb.com'>Toronto Ruby Brigade</a>. It seemed like a crazy idea at the time - I was by no means a good Ruby developer at the time, and looking back on it I got by mostly on bravado, and certainly not code quality. But I figured the best way to get my feet wet was to dive right in.
</p>

<p>
  <b>The experience was fantastic.</b> There's so many benefits to jumping in and helping organize a user group, that I think almost anyone, regardless of skill level, should try it out. Here's 7 reasons I think it will be a great experience:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <h3>You get to know more people in your community</h3>
    <p>The first reason, and the reason I started helping out with the Toronto Ruby brigade, is that participating exposes you to way more interesting people in your local Ruby community. It's an awesome feeling going to a pub night and having a ton of smart, interesting people to catch up with. You probably have some amazing developers in your city, and starting or participating in events is the best way to find them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Recruitment is way easier.</h3>
    <p>If you're hiring, recruitment is WAY easier if you have a reputation in your local community through events, especially if you work for a smaller startup. Most people in here are working for companies that are looking for developers. My company hired 4 out of 5 developers through running events like Hack nights. Running events lets developers know your company exists, and is interested in giving back to the community.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>It's way less nerve-wracking than talking at RailsConf.</h3>
    <p>This one was theoretical until about 2 days ago, but I can totally confirm this is true. Doing talks in your local community is a great way to dip your toes into doing public speaking without it needing to be to a whole room of people at a giant event.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Not everyone can make it to big conferences.</h3>
    <p>National conferences are awesome, but not everyone can go to them. It's great to have local content that's cheap and accessible for people who want to improve their skills and learn things. Think about doing a talk about what you learned at a bigger conference. Everyone who wasn't able to go will be grateful for it, and your content is already done for you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>It's less hard than you think it is.</h3>
    <p>Planning something like a Hack night isn't that difficult. You don't need to be an expert. I had 6 months of Ruby or Rails experience when I started running Hack nights. I was still a beginner, and it worked out great. And the planning isn't as hard as you may think either. Make your office available for a few hours on a weekday night – it really doesn’t need to be more complicated than that to start.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Strong dev communities are great - and you can make them happen.</h3>
    <p>There's so many benefits to living in a city with a strong dev community. But strong communities don't just happen, they take time and effort to create. You can make a measurable difference in how great your community is with just a bit of effort.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Spread the Rails love</h3>
    <p>There's probably a lot of people in your city who are stuck developing in PHP or Java, really want to learn about Rails, but don't know where to start. About 25% of the people who come to our hack nights have either never used Rails, or have less than 1 month of experience. That's awesome. Every single month, we get 5-10 new people started using Rails.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>So what are you waiting for? Find your local user group, and start a new event. If you don't have a local user group, start one. It really doesn't need to be anything more than 5 guys getting a drink together to start.</p>
